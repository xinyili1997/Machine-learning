The main goal today(Lecture1) is to talk about how to formulate a problem so that we can solve it with ML.

<1> WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?
      1.1 The basic goal of AI is to develop intelligent machines
           The sub goals are:
	* Perception - perceive or be aware of the enviroment
	* Reasoning -  like playing games
	* Control/Motion/Manipulation - AI agent for robotic
	* Planning 
	* Communication - interactive like siri
	* Creativity
	* Learning - an agent that can react with the world dynamically #what we want
      1.2 The goal of this course is to provide you with ML toolbox
	* Machine Learning
	* Statistics
	* Probability
	* Computer science
	* Optimization
            A good application is with ML with your own domain of interest!
      1.3  The problems that had been solved with ML
	* Speech Recognition - learning to recognize spoken words
	* Robotics - learning to drive an autonomous vehicle
	* Games / Reasoning - learning to beat the masters at board games # deep reinforcement learning
	* Computer Vision - learning to classify imagines # a hidden Markov model
	* Learning Theory - in what cases and how well can we learn?
P17 TOPICS AND KEY QUESTIONS

<2> DEFINING LEARNING PROBLEMS
      2.1 Well-posed Learning Problems
	* Three components <T, P, E>
	   1. Task, T
	   2. Performance measure, P
	   3. Experience, E
	* Definition of learning: 
	   A computer program learns if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
      #example: learning to beat the masters at chess
	T = play chess; 
	P = how many steps, score function, weighted move, ... ; 
	E = learning from records, fighting with real componets, play with AI itself;
      #example: respond to voice commands (siri)
	* solution: Annotate Data and Learn
	   1. Collect raw sentatences {x1, x2, ... , xn}
                   2. Experts annotate their meaning {y1, y2, ... , yn}
	T = predicting action from speech; 
	P = percent of correct actions taken in user pilot study; 
	E = examples pf (speech, action) pairs;
      2.2 Problem Formulation
	#what is the structure of our output prediction
	  - regression: scores
	  - density estimation: probability of fail
	  - classification: decision
